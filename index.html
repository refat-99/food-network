                  <p>Food Network programming is divided into a daytime block known as "Food
                        Network in the Kitchen" and
                        a primetime lineup branded as "Food Network Nighttime". Generally, "In the Kitchen" is dedicated
                        to instructional cooking programs, while "Nighttime" features food-related entertainment
                        programs, such as cooking competitions, food-related travel shows, and reality shows. Promos
                        identify "Food Network Nighttime" programming but not "In the Kitchen" daytime programming. </p>
